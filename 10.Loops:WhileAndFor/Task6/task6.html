<!-- Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. 
If the visitor enters another number  – ask them to input again.
The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters 
a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.
Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. 
There’s no need to implement a special handling for 
a non-numeric input in this task. -->
